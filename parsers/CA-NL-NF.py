# This parser fetches demand data for Canada-Newfoundland. The source-website https://nlhydro.com/ states:
# "Current Island System Generation", so I assume only generation for Newfoundland island, excluding Labrador, is shown.
# "Current system generation = current demand on the system" and
# "Any generation from non-utility generators, including Star Lake, Rattle Brook, Corner Brook Pulp and Paper,
# and wind generation from the St. Lawrence and Fermeuse wind farms, is included in our Hydro System Generation."
# This means we have a mix of hydro, oil, biomass and wind energy represented in the demand/generation figure.
